# Geekster - Sprint Plan

A timeline guessing game for video game screenshots. Similar to Hitster, but instead of songs, players place video game screenshots in chronological order.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend/Backend:** SvelteKit (TypeScript)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** JSON file (SQLite deferred to Sprint 4)
- **Hosting:** Vercel / Cloudflare Pages (free tier)

---

## Sprint 1 - Foundation & Core Game Loop (MVP) ✅

> Goal: A playable single-player game with hardcoded data

### User Stories

- [x] US-1.1: As a player, I see a welcome screen with a "Start Game" button
- [x] US-1.2: As a player, I see a first screenshot with its release year as the anchor on a timeline
- [x] US-1.3: As a player, I see a new screenshot and must place it before or after the existing one(s)
- [x] US-1.4: As a player, I get visual feedback whether my placement was correct or wrong
- [x] US-1.5: As a player, I win when I have 10 games correctly placed in the timeline
- [x] US-1.6: As a player, I see a game-over/win screen with the final timeline

### Tech Tasks

- Project setup (SvelteKit + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript)
- Game data as JSON (15-20 games with name, year, screenshot placeholder)
- Core game state logic (timeline, placement validation, win condition)
- Basic responsive UI

---

## Sprint 2 - Game Database & Polish ✅

> Goal: Enough content for replayability, better UX

### User Stories

- [x] US-2.1: As a player, I get a different set of games each round (randomized from 55-game pool)
- [x] US-2.2: As a player, I see smooth animations when placing a game in the timeline
- [x] US-2.3: As a player, I see the game name + year revealed after placing it
- [x] US-2.4: As a player, I can restart the game after winning or losing
- [x] US-2.5: As a maintainer, I can easily add new games to the database

### Tech Tasks

- ~~Migrate from JSON to SQLite database~~ (deferred to Sprint 4)
- CLI tool for adding games (`npm run game:add`)
- Expanded to 55 games in JSON database
- Animations: fly transitions, fade transitions, slide reveal
- Reveal flow: name + year shown for ~2s after placement
- "Play Again" (restart) and "Main Menu" buttons on result screen
- Sticky current card + larger touch targets on mobile

---

## Sprint 3 - Lives, Streak & Drag-and-Drop ✅

> Goal: More engaging gameplay with tactile interactions

### User Stories

- [x] US-3.1: As a player, I can drag and drop the current game card into the available timeline slots
- [x] US-3.2: As a player, I have limited wrong guesses (3 lives)
- [x] US-3.3: As a player, I see my current score and streak
- [x] US-3.4: As a player, during drag the existing timeline games get minified (year + title only) to minimize scrolling

### Tech Tasks

- Drag and drop: HTML5 DnD for desktop + custom touch drag (long-press) for mobile
- Timeline card minification during drag (compact name + year bars)
- Lives/health system (3 lives, game over at 0)
- Streak tracking (consecutive correct placements)
- Updated header UI: lives indicators + streak counter
- Auto-scroll during touch drag near viewport edges
- Updated welcome screen instructions

---

## Sprint 4 - Bonus Points & Knowledge ✅

> Goal: Reward deeper gaming knowledge

### User Stories

- [x] US-4.1: As a player, I can optionally guess the exact release year for bonus points
- [x] US-4.2: As a player, I can optionally guess the game's name for bonus points
- [x] US-4.3: As a player, I see a final score that reflects both ordering + bonus points
- [x] US-4.4: As a player, I see a leaderboard of my own past scores (local storage)

### Tech Tasks

- Bonus point input UI (year guess, name guess)
- Scoring algorithm (proximity-based for year, fuzzy match for name)
- Local storage leaderboard

---

## Sprint 5 - Real Screenshots & UI Polish ✅

> Goal: Production-quality visuals

### Tech Tasks

- [x] Replaced SVG placeholders with real game screenshots
- [x] Screenshot audit: replaced images showing game titles/logos with clean gameplay shots
- [x] i18n support with language switcher
- [x] GitHub Pages deployment

---

## Sprint 6 - Backend Foundation & Database ✅

> Goal: Migrate from static JSON to a real backend with database, enabling future admin panel, multiplayer, and global leaderboard

### Why Now

The static JSON + GitHub Pages approach works for the current game, but cannot support:

- Admin panel for managing games/screenshots without git
- Multiple screenshots per game (difficulty levels)
- Global leaderboard (requires server-side persistence)
- Multiplayer (requires real-time server)

### Architecture Decisions

| Component         | Choice                                               | Rationale                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Database**      | SQLite via **Turso** (libSQL)                        | Free tier (500 DBs, 9 GB, 500M reads/mo). Relational data model fits game/screenshot/score relationships. No server to manage |
| **ORM**           | **Drizzle**                                          | Type-safe, lightweight, excellent SQLite/Turso support                                                                        |
| **Image storage** | **Vercel Blob**                                      | Free tier, no git bloat, CDN-backed. Chosen over R2: same platform, one env var, no S3 SDK                                    |
| **Hosting**       | **Vercel** (move from GitHub Pages)                  | Free tier supports SSR + API routes. GitHub Pages is static-only                                                              |
| **Auth (admin)**  | Simple password via env var (upgrade to OAuth later) | Minimal setup for single-admin use case                                                                                       |

```

### User Stories

- [x] US-6.1: As a developer, the game loads data from an API instead of a static JSON file
- [x] US-6.2: As a developer, game data is stored in a SQLite database (Turso)
- [x] US-6.3: As a developer, screenshots are served from blob storage instead of the git repo
- [x] US-6.4: As a developer, I can deploy the app to Vercel with SSR support
- [x] US-6.5: As a player, the game works exactly as before (no visible changes)

### Tech Tasks

#### 6a — Database Setup

- [x] Install Drizzle ORM + Turso client (`@libsql/client`, `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit`)
- [x] Define schema in `src/lib/server/schema.ts`
- [x] Configure Drizzle for Turso connection (`drizzle.config.ts`)
- [x] Create and run initial migration
- [x] Write seed script: import all 125 games from `games.json` into the database

#### 6b — API Routes

- [x] `GET /api/games` — list all games (used by game logic)
- [x] `GET /api/games/random?count=10&difficulty=medium` — get random game set for a round
- [x] `POST /api/scores` — submit a score to the global leaderboard
- [x] `GET /api/scores?limit=20` — fetch top scores

#### 6c — Screenshot Migration

Provider decision: **Vercel Blob** over Cloudflare R2 — already on Vercel, one package
(`@vercel/blob`) and one env var, and 5 MB of screenshots is far inside the free tier.

- [x] Choose provider and install the client (`@vercel/blob`)
- [x] Write migration script: `npm run blob:migrate` — uploads `static/screenshots/*.webp`,
      then rewrites `screenshots.url` in the database (`--dry-run` / `--force` supported)
- [x] Update frontend to handle absolute blob URLs (`resolveScreenshotUrl()` in `src/lib/imageUrl.ts`)
- [x] Create the Blob store and set `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` — store `geekster-screenshots`
      (`store_INcAJWeUsvrWGj0t`, region fra1, **access: public**). Note: a store's access mode is
      fixed at creation; a private store cannot serve images to `<img src>`
- [x] Run `npm run blob:migrate` against the production database — 125/125 uploaded,
      all `screenshots.url` rows now absolute, served with `cache-control: max-age=31536000`

#### 6d — Frontend Migration

- [x] Replace `games.json` import with `fetch('/api/games/random')` in game state
- [x] Update score submission to `POST /api/scores`
- [x] Keep local storage leaderboard as fallback, add global leaderboard tab
- [x] Ensure all existing features work identically

#### 6e — Deployment

- [x] Add Vercel adapter (`@sveltejs/adapter-vercel`)
- [x] Configure environment variables (Turso URL, Turso auth token, R2 credentials)
- [x] Deploy to Vercel
- [x] Verify production build

## Sprint 7 - Admin Panel

> Goal: Web-based admin interface for managing games and screenshots

### Ground Rules Carried Over From Sprint 6

Everything the admin panel needs on the infrastructure side already exists — these are the
constraints it has to work within.

**Blob uploads.** Store `geekster-screenshots` (`store_INcAJWeUsvrWGj0t`, region fra1,
**public** access). `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is set in Vercel for Development, Preview and
Production, so a server-side upload from an admin route works without further setup. Match the
convention `scripts/migrate-screenshots-to-blob.js` uses, or the two will drift:

```ts
put(`screenshots/${slug}.webp`, file, {
	access: 'public', // required — the store is public and cannot be switched later
	addRandomSuffix: false, // the slug IS the identity; a suffix breaks re-uploads
	allowOverwrite: true, // replacing a screenshot keeps the same pathname
	contentType: 'image/webp',
	cacheControlMaxAge: 31536000
});
```

**The database is the single source of truth — decided.** A SvelteKit API route runs as a Vercel
serverless function with a read-only filesystem, so anything created in the admin panel can never
reach `games.json`. That settles ownership: the database holds the real data, `games.json` is
demoted to seed data for a fresh or local environment — a test-data generator, nothing more.

Two consequences, both to be handled in 7a before any admin feature exists:

- **The runtime fallback goes away.** `fetchGames()` currently swallows an API error and serves the
  bundled JSON, which would quietly hide a broken database and serve a stale catalogue. If the
  service is unavailable, there is no game — show the error, let the player retry.
- **`db:seed` must stop deleting.** Today it runs `DELETE FROM screenshots` / `DELETE FROM games`
  and rebuilds from the JSON. Against a database that holds admin-entered games, that is silent
  data loss. It also reassigns every ID: SQLite `AUTOINCREMENT` never reuses a value after a
  `DELETE`, so re-seeding today's 125 games renumbers them from 126 upward and breaks every
  `/admin/games/<id>` link. Verified, not assumed.

**Schema changes need real migrations.** There is no `drizzle/` directory — the current schema was
created by raw `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements inside `seed-database.js` plus `db:push`.
Any new table (admin sessions, audit log) should go through `npm run db:generate` +
`npm run db:migrate` so the history exists from here on.

**Env vars are a manual step.** Claude Code is blocked from writing Vercel environment variables
(the harness classifies it as a secret-store write). `ADMIN_PASSWORD` or any other new secret has
to be added by hand in the Vercel dashboard, for each environment, and mirrored into the local
`.env`. Note that `TURSO_*` is currently set for Preview and Production only — not Development.

**Where it lives.** <https://geekster.pro/admin> — `www` 308-redirects to the apex.

### User Stories

- [x] US-7.1: As an admin, I can log in to a protected admin area
- [x] US-7.2: As an admin, I can view all games in a sortable/filterable table
- [x] US-7.3: As an admin, I can add a new game (name, year) and upload screenshots
- [x] US-7.4: As an admin, I can edit a game's details and manage its screenshots
- [x] US-7.5: As an admin, I can delete a game
- [x] US-7.6: As an admin, I can assign difficulty levels to individual screenshots
- [x] US-7.7: As an admin, I can fetch screenshot candidates from RAWG API and pick the best one
- [x] US-7.8: As a player, if the game data cannot be loaded, I see a clear error and can retry
      instead of silently playing an outdated catalogue

### Tech Tasks

#### 7a — Data Ownership (before any admin feature)

- [x] Remove the `games.json` fallback from `fetchGames()` in `src/lib/game.svelte.ts`
- [x] Surface the failure: add an error field to `GameState`, keep the phase on `welcome`, show the
      message on `WelcomeScreen.svelte` with the start button as the retry
- [x] Add the EN/DE strings for it to `i18n.svelte.ts`
- [x] Drop the "frontend falls back to static JSON" comment in `src/routes/api/games/random/+server.ts`
- [x] Rework `scripts/seed-database.js` into a real seeder: upsert by `slug` (insert missing games,
      update `name`/`year`, never delete), leave `screenshots.url` untouched when it already holds an
      absolute URL, and refuse to run against a non-empty database without `--force`
- [x] Note in `games.json` that it is seed data, not the live catalogue

> JSON cannot carry a comment, so the note lives in `src/lib/data/README.md` next to the file
> rather than inside it. `games.json` itself stays a plain array — five scripts parse it.
>
> `GameState.error` holds a _translation key_, not a message. `i18n.svelte.ts` gained `tk(key)`
> for looking a key up at runtime; it returns the key unchanged when it is unknown.

#### 7b — Auth & Layout

- [x] Admin auth middleware (check password/token from env var)
- [x] Admin layout with sidebar navigation (`/admin`)
- [x] Protected route group (`src/routes/admin/`)

#### 7c — Game Management

- [x] `/admin/games` — game list with search, sort by name/year
- [x] `/admin/games/new` — add game form with screenshot upload
- [x] `/admin/games/[id]` — edit game, manage screenshots
- [x] Delete game with confirmation
- [x] Bulk import from CSV/JSON

#### 7d — Screenshot Management

- [x] Upload screenshots directly to blob storage from admin
- [x] RAWG integration: search game, preview screenshots, one-click import
- [x] Set difficulty per screenshot (easy/medium/hard)
- [x] Set primary screenshot flag
- [x] Image preview and downscale on upload — crop deferred to a later sprint

#### 7e — Dashboard

- [x] `/admin` — overview: total games, total scores, recent activity
- [x] Quick-add game form on dashboard

### What Sprint 7 Actually Built

**Auth.** `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is the whole mechanism: `src/lib/server/auth.ts` compares it in
constant time and signs a `<expiry>.<hmac>` session cookie with the password as the HMAC key, so
changing the password in the Vercel dashboard logs every session out. Sessions last 12 hours.
`src/hooks.server.ts` sets `locals.admin`, redirects `/admin/**` to `/admin/login` and answers
`/api/admin/**` with 401. **When `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is unset the admin area is closed, not open** —
the login page says so instead of failing silently. There is no rate limiting: a Vercel function
has no shared memory to count attempts in, so the password has to carry that weight on its own.

**Blob uploads.** `@vercel/blob` reads `process.env` directly, which under `vite dev` does not
carry `.env` — so `src/lib/server/blob.ts` passes `token` explicitly on every `put`/`del`. The
upload convention matches `scripts/migrate-screenshots-to-blob.js`; a game's second and later
screenshots land under `screenshots/<slug>-2.webp`, `-3` and so on. Deleting a game or a
screenshot also deletes the blob; local `/screenshots/...` paths from the seed data are left
alone because those files live in the repository.

**Images.** `ScreenshotUpload.svelte` re-encodes the selection to WebP in the browser and scales
the longest edge to 1600px before the form is sent, so the store never receives a 6 MB PNG. It
degrades to a plain upload without JS. A crop UI was not built.

**RAWG.** `RAWG_API_KEY` is optional; without it the import panel says so and everything else
works. `fetchRawgImage()` refuses any URL that is not on `rawg.io` — the image URL comes from the
browser, so it is untrusted input and could otherwise be pointed at an internal address.

**The admin UI is English-only** — it is a single-operator tool and the EN/DE machinery would
double every string for no one's benefit.

**Environment variables, as of 2026-09-19.** `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set for **Production** (via
`vercel env add`, which does work from here — the earlier note that Claude Code cannot write Vercel
env vars applies to the REST API path, where reading the CLI's stored auth token is blocked).
**Preview has none**, because `vercel env add <name> preview` insists on a git-branch answer that
the CLI will not accept non-interactively; add it in the dashboard if the admin panel should work
on preview deployments. `RAWG_API_KEY` is optional and unset.

**Two stages, not three.** Vercel's `Development` environment cannot be deleted, so it is left
unpopulated: local work runs `npm run dev` against the repo's `.env`, never `vercel dev`. That
`.env` points `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` at `file:local.db` — with an admin panel that deletes games and
blob files, a local session must not be able to reach production. The live credentials sit in the
file commented out. Note the asymmetry: there is only one blob store, so a local upload still
writes to the live store.
