## Sprint 2 - Game Database & Polish ✅

> Goal: Enough content for replayability, better UX

### User Stories

- [x] US-2.1: As a player, I get a different set of games each round (randomized from 55-game pool)
- [x] US-2.2: As a player, I see smooth animations when placing a game in the timeline
- [x] US-2.3: As a player, I see the game name + year revealed after placing it
- [x] US-2.4: As a player, I can restart the game after winning or losing
- [x] US-2.5: As a maintainer, I can easily add new games to the database

### Tech Tasks

- ~~Migrate from JSON to SQLite database~~ (deferred to Sprint 4)
- CLI tool for adding games (`npm run game:add`)
- Expanded to 55 games in JSON database
- Animations: fly transitions, fade transitions, slide reveal
- Reveal flow: name + year shown for ~2s after placement
- "Play Again" (restart) and "Main Menu" buttons on result screen
- Sticky current card + larger touch targets on mobile
